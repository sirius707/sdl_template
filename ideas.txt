different characters can assign, or adjust certain values (dx, dy etc)upon entering a state
for example chun li can change dx if she hits a wall 
this can be loaded from the character file and applied in the logic_fsm

we can go two routes when it comes to game play, streetfighter route and tekken route
in street fighter, detecting actions happens out side the FSM switch, 
for example if an action button [kick or punch, even a combo executed]is presed, we go to attack animation depending 
on the value of a boolean called can_hit. which will be set true in states like idle, walking etc
this might allow animation cancelling, we gotta test this

tekken route:
all combos are defined in an adjacency table the execution of an attack depends on the value of can_hit and whether there is an entry for it 
in the adjacency table
